Vert.igo
========

Vertigo is a distributed event processing framework built on the
[Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) application platform. Following a concept and
structure similar to [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm), Vertigo
allows real-time problems to be broken down into smaller tasks (as Vert.x
verticles) and distributed across **one or many Vert.x instances**, managing
communication between components in a **predictable and reliable** manner.

* Supports simple pipelines or complex networks of Vert.x modules/verticles,
  including remote procedure calls spanning multiple Vert.x verticle instances
* Supports message ack/fail/timeout mechanisms, providing data sources
  with feedback on the state of processing simple or complex message trees
* Monitors networks for failures and automatically reassigns/redeploys failed
  verticles and modules
* Can distribute verticle/module instances among a single Vert.x instance or
  across a cluster of Vert.x instances
* Network components can be written in any Vert.x supported language, with
  current integration for Java and Python
* Integrates seemlessly with existing Vert.x applications

Vertigo is not a replacement for [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm).
Rather, Vertigo is a lightweight - albeit less reliable - alternative that
is intended to be embedded in larger Vert.x applications.

## How it works

### Networks
A network is the representation of a collection of components - special Vert.x
verticle implementations- and the connections between them. Put together,
a network processes streams of data in real-time. Vertigo puts no limitations
on network structures. Each component may be connected to zero or many other components,
and circular relationships may be created as well. Networks are defined using
the `NetworkDefinition` API and deployed using [Via](https://github.com/kuujo/via)
clusters.

This is an example of a complex network. Given a set of Vert.x verticles or
modules, Vertigo uses a code-based representation of the network structure
to define connections between network components, start component verticles
or modules, monitor components, and manage communication between them in a fast,
reliable manner.

See the [complex network example](https://github.com/kuujo/vertigo/tree/master/examples/java/complex)

### Components
A component represents a single vertex in a Vertigo network graph. Each network
may contain any number of components, and each component may have any number of
instances running within the network (each of which may be assigned to different
machines around a cluster). Within the context of Vert.x a component can be
defined as a verticle that may receive messages from zero or many verticles and
send messages to one or many verticles. What happens within the verticle depends
entirely where they appear in a network graph and how the component is implemented.
Fortunately, Vertigo provides several types of components for common tasks.

#### Feeders
Feeders are components whose sole responsibility is to feed data to a network.
Data generated by feeders may come from any source, and Vertigo provides a number
of feeder implementations for integrating networks with a variety of Vert.x and
other APIs.

**Java**
```java
BasicFeeder feeder = vertigo.createBasicFeeder();
feeder.start(new Handler<AsyncResult<BasicFeeder>>() {
  public void handle(AsyncResult<BasicFeeder> result) {
    BasicFeeder feeder = result.result();

    feeder.setMaxQueueSize(1000);
    final JsonObject data = new JsonObject().putString("body", "Hello world!");

    feeder.feed(data, new Handler<AsyncResult<Void>>() {
      public void handle(AsyncResult<Void> result) {
        if (result.failed()) {
          // Processing failed. Re-emit the message.
          feeder.feed(data);
        }
        else {
          // Processing succeeded!
        }
      }
    });
  }
});
```

**Python**
```python
feeder = vertigo.create_basic_feeder()

def start_handler(error, feeder):
  if not error:
    def ack_handler(error):
      if not error:
        pass # Message was successfully processed!
    feeder.feed({'body': 'Hello world!'}, ack_handler)

feeder.start(start_handler)
```

#### Workers
Worker components are the primary units of processing in Vertigo. Workers
are designed to both receive input and emit output (though workers can do
one or the other). The processes that are performed in between depend
entirely on the implementation.

**Java**
```java
final Worker worker = vertigo.createWorker();
worker.messageHandler(new Handler<JsonMessage>() {
  public void handle(JsonMessage message) {
    JsonArray words = message.getArray("words").size();
    if (words != null) {
      // Emit the number of words.
      worker.emit(new JsonObject().putNumber("count", words), message);
      worker.ack(message);
    }
    else {
      // This is an invalid message. Fail it.
      worker.fail(message);
    }
  }
}).start();
```

**Python**
```python
worker = vertigo.create_worker()

@worker.message_handler
def message_handler(message):
  if message.body.has_key('words'):
    worker.emit({'count': len(message.body['words'])}, parent=message)
    worker.ack(message)
  else:
    worker.fail(message)
```

Note that the API provides additional reliability features - message acking.
See [how message acking works](#message-acking)

#### Executors
Executors are components that execute part or all of a network essential
as a remote procedure invocation. Data emitted from executors is tagged
with a unique ID, and new messages received by the executor are correlated
with past emissions.

### Defining networks
Networks are defined in code using an object-oriented API. The network definition
API supports defining networks of virtually any structure, and Vertigo puts no
limitations on network topologies. Just as network components can be written
in any Vert.x supported language, networks can be defined using any Vert.x language.

Some [examples](https://github.com/kuujo/vertigo/tree/master/examples/java/complex)
demonstrate how the network definition API works.

### Messaging
One of the primary responsibilities of Vertigo is managing communication between
network components in a consistent, predictable, and reliable manner. Vertigo
uses the Vert.x event bus for inter-component communication, but Vertigo also
provides many reliability features on top of the event bus.

#### How components communicate
Network components communicate with each other directly over the event bus
rather than being routed through a central message broker. When a network
is created, Vertigo assigns unique addresses *to each component (verticle)
instance* which that verticle uses to communicate with the verticles around
it. Thus, each component instance essentially maintains a direct connection
to its neighbors, ensuring fast messaging between them.

![Communication Channels](http://s7.postimg.org/unzwkrvgb/vertigo_channel.png)

#### Groupings
With each component instance maintaining its own unique event bus address,
Vertigo needs a way to determine which component messages emitted from one
component are dispatched to. Each component may indicate a *grouping* which
determines how messages are distributed among multiple instances of the
component. For instance, one component may need to receive all messages
emitted to it, while another may be need to receive messages in a round-robin
fashion. Vertigo provides groupings for various scenarios, including
consistent-hashing based groupings. Custom component groupings may also
be provided.

#### Filters
Vertigo messages contain metadata in addition to the message body. And just
as with grouping component instances, sometimes components may be only
interested in receiving messages containing specific metadata. For this,
Vertigo provides message filters which allow components to define the types
of messages they receive. As with groupings, custom filters may be provided.

### Message acking
Vertigo's implicit control over the messaging infrastructure of component
verticles allows it to provide some unique reliability features. When a
Vertigo network is deployed, a special verticle called the *auditor* verticle
is deployed along with it. The Vertigo *auditor* is tasked with monitoring
messages within the network, tracking acks and nacks throughout the network,
and notifying *feeders* when a message tree fails.

![Network Auditor](http://s14.postimg.org/kkl297qo1/vertigo_acker.png)

#### How acking works

When a *feeder* component creates and emits a new message, the feeder's
`OutputCollector` will notify the network's *auditor* of the newly created
message. *It is the responsibility of each worker component to ack or fail
the message*. If a worker creates a child of the message, the auditor is
told about the new relationship. If a descendant of a message is failed,
the original feeder will be notified of the failure. The feeder may
optionally replay failed messages through the network. Once *all*
descendants of a message have been successfully *acked*, the original
feeder will be notified. The *auditor* maintains a timer for each message
tree (the timers are actually shared among several message trees). If the
timer is triggered prior to the entire message tree being *acked*, the
tree will be failed and the original feeder will be notified.

### Clustering
Vertigo provides APIs for deploying networks both locally (within a single
Vert.x instance) as well as distributing network components across multiple
Vert.x instances using [Via](https://github.com/kuujo/via), a distributed
deployment framework for Vert.x (Via was specifically developed for Vertigo).

```java
final Cluster cluster = new LocalCluster(vertx, container);
cluster.deploy(network, new Handler<AsyncResult<NetworkContext>>() {
  public void handle(AsyncResult<NetworkContext> result) {
    if (result.succeeded()) {
      NetworkContext context = result.result();
      cluster.shutdown(context);
    }
  }
});
```
