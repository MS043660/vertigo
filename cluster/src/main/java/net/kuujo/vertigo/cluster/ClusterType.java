/**
 * Annotates a handler as being available in cluster mode.<p>
 *
 * This annotation should be used for identifying types available within
 * Vertigo components as being available when clustering (e.g. in remote mode).
 * When a network is being run in cluster mode, Vertigo synchronization types
 * must be supported by clustering. If clustering is not supported by a type
 * then Vertigo will automatically fall back to a type that is supported.
