/**
 * Annotates a handler as being available in local mode.<p>
 *
 * This annotation should be used for identifying types available within
 * Vertigo components as being available within local deployments (e.g. in local mode).
 * When a network is being run in local mode, Vertigo synchronization types
 * must be supported within a single Vert.x instance. If local mode is not supported
 * by a type then Vertigo will automatically fall back to a type that is supported.
